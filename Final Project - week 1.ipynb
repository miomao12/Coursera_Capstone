    "The best neighborhood for this new branch would not necessarily be in downtown San Francisco and can even be in residential area, but needs to be properly busy on both weekdays/weekends and safetiness of the area is also one of the important points to consider. The number of existing Japanese restaurants in neighborhood is also another guiding principle for the decision. \n"
